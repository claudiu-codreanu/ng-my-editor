# My Angular WYSIWYG Editor

Little app which I wrote in order to learn Angular basics. It follows Chapter 5 (Building a WYSIWYG Editor for the Desktop using Electron) of the book <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/product/angular-projects-second-edition/9781800205260" target="_blank">*Angular Projects 2nd edition*</a>.

<br>

It displays a simple rich text editor with a toolbar and main content area, which can be packed and deployed as desktop native app using Electron.

That way you can save your work to the host file system, and open local files for editing.

<br>

The instructions in the book are clear and easy to follow. However the subject matter itself is quite challenging. Angular is verbose and complex, so the learning curve is steep.

<br>

But it was fun, and I look forward to the remaining 7 chapters!
